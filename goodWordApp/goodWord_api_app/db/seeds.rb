        "content": "“Do I look chartreuse to you?” Asks Gus, a twenty-three-year-old yogi as we wait for our matcha lattes in his favorite Brooklyn cafe. “My lady says I look chartreuse,” he squints at me, “But I think it’s more of a minty hue.” Apparently, his yoga students noticed that his face was not its usual red when he was entering the twentieth minute of his patented Inverted Gus-Stand. Though the blood was rushing to his head, his face was a dull green. “One of the disciples pulled me out of my Gus-Stand and took my vitals. She’s an EMT. I think everything would have been fine once I folded my chakras into position. But some people just stir up drama, saving lives wherever they go!”

        When asked for his last name at the hospital, he allegedly replied, “Just ‘Gus’ man.” So the green man’s true identity is still a mystery. Over matcha, Gus admitted that he has been experimenting with being Ketotarian for the past three months. His green routine starts with an asparagus smoothie and pea protein supplement before sunrise yoga. He follows it up with a lunch frittata of spinach and asparagus. For dinner, he has a sensible three cups of steamed asparagus, washed down with a gallon of asparagus-infused water mixed with blue-green algae. The hospital refused to comment on the diagnosis of a patient, but a yoga student told me that to reach nirvana, Gus has told them to set intentions to become one with their spirit vegetables. Beetroota wished to remain anonymous. I told her it that it would be my pleasure to only use the name she gave me, which could not possibly be anyone’s government name. So, it turns out that the green hue of his skin may actually be a sign that Gus is close to achieving vegetarian enlightenment.
        
        “I live for my post-sunset yoga dessert,” Gus grabs my face with two very green hands, “If you have never indulged in a kiwi-asparagus vegan gelatin sweetened with stevia, you have not lived!” I try to smile, but he refuses to let go until I agree to attend his next yoga class. When he is finished, I slurp the last of my latte and start to sweat at the thought of folding my chakras. Pleasantly, I was surprised to find that tree pose can lead to a yearning for Swiss chard. After a week of daily yoga with Gus, I am proud to report that I have embraced my inner vegetarian, started a leafy meditation practice and would like to invite our readership to become disciples of Gus. He will change your life and his pee smells amazing.",

        "content": "Electric Avenue has become a hotspot of controversy following the State's decision to perform construction on it. Built in 1982, Electric Avenue is was constructed as an expressway to the upper city with no delay, but recent events have made it a sprawling dystopian nightmare.

        We spoke with Eddy Grant, a member of the local community. 'We used to be able to rock right down to Electric Avenue, but now it's a nightmare. They have it down to one lane and the delays are headache,'' says Eddy. He further remarked 'out in the daytime, out in the nighttime, you still can't get higher.' Eddy is just one of many impacted by this road construction, and the civil unrest is growing by the day, many feel that the expressway did not even need roadwork.
        
        We sought out an interview with Mayor Kneed Smoretaxes to ask why the city planning commission made this decision in the first place. 'Well this is California, we got funding from the State if we took 4 of our most used roads and put them under construction at the same time. It's roads like SB110 the 'stairway to heaven' as well.' Says Smoretaxes. Mayor Smoretaxes has recently come under scrutiny, as many say this road construction makes toll roads more favorable. 'Well taxes from those (toll) roads are hard at work tearing apart and rebuilding our perfectly good service streets.' The Mayor commented. Road construction began 5 years ago, and many fear it will never be completed. 'Look here, despite California taxing most of its population into poverty we just don't have the funding right now to run these crews. So construction is just going to be indefinite. Now if you'll excuse me I need to take my chopper up to Sactemento,' and with that Mayor Smoretaxes cut our interview short to campaign for the banning of smores as he say they violate CA's EPA laws.",

I couldn’t figure out was what holding me down, and when I reached up, I found these bloody things! Literally bloody! Like they’d just burst forth from my skull—sorry was that too graphic?’

        While on one of her regular hikes to forage for mushrooms in the woods, Middleton and her companions were met by a family of deer. “They were so sweet and peaceful, we fed them mushrooms from our day’s harvest. ‘They weren’t anything special—cross my heart—they were just some beautiful yellow chanterelles. But, as soon as they bit into them, they couldn’t have enough. They ate our whole stash and nipped my fingers while they were at it!’
        
        It’s hard to say exactly what caused the growth on Middleton’s head, doctors are stumped by the unique phenomenon. Despite many tests, physicians have yet to find an explanation. ‘We believe it to be some kind of papilloma virus, but we haven’t found any abnormal cells. Even the antlers, themselves, appear to have no foreign cells,’ says Dr. Pamela Raymore, head of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, NJ location. 
        
        Nonetheless, Middleton isn’t letting the new appendages get her down, ‘You know, my husband thinks they’re unique and exotic and I’m basically a celebrity in town. So, you know, I’m into it,’ she says with a shrug.",

        "category": "NewYork",
        "content": "It seems the impossible has happened. A mere two and a half years after the MTA’s ‘summer of hell’ in 2017, the MTA announced the highest train ‘on time’ rates since 2013. According to MTA president Andy Byford, weekday subways ran at a rate of 84% on time, with delays down 52% in the last twelve months. 

        New Yorkers are overjoyed. A mostly-on-time subway? It’s a dream come true for the millions of straphangers who use the trains to commute to work every day. But others are confused by the news. 
        
        With daily reports of failing signals, doors opening mid-ride, a transit chief who keeps trying to resign his post so he doesn’t have to deal with a difficult governor, some have begun to wonder how, in the midst of all this trouble, this marvelous change of fates could have come about. 
        
        ‘I’m telling you, it’s aliens,’ said Jo Vane, a Brooklyn resident. ‘There’s no other explanation for it. Cuomo’s too stuck up to get anything done, de Blasio is too busy commuting by car to his gym, and Byford’s hands are tied. It’s got to be aliens.’
        
        When asked if she had any proof of extraterrestrial involvement in our city’s transit, Vane pointed to the sudden increase of police officers in stations. ‘With so many other things the NYPD could be doing, the only plausible explanation is that they expect the martian conductors to reveal themselves during a routine subway stop.’ Asked about her certainty that the helpful aliens were indeed from Mars, Vane replied, ‘They’re our closest neighbors. If they were coming from somewhere like one of Jupiter’s moons, surely they wouldn’t be here yet.’
        
        When asked, Matthew Castro, another subway rider on his way to work, confirmed that he too had considered the possibility that the MTA was being run by forces outside the city, the state, the country, and even the Earth. ‘It was so messed up, and now it’s gotten better. Nothing has changed anywhere else, man, and everything is going to—’ here he used a word that we cannot in good conscience print ‘—so yeah, it’s got to be aliens. Martians, probably. We all know it. It’s, like, common sense at this point.’
        
        We were even able to get corroboration for this story from right within the Good Word newsroom. Fellow city desk reporter Cordelia Houston recalls a night in late December when she happened to be exiting her local station behind a train conductor getting off of work, and recalls that he (the conductor) appeared to glow around the collar, as if his skin were emitting a faint green light. When asked whether her train had indeed run on time, Houston (author of last week’s exposé on common pigeons trained to spy on city council meetings by candidates hoping to challenge sitting members in the 2021 elections) recalls that the timing of her commute precisely matched that predicted by her favorite transit apps. 
        
        ‘Your sources are right,’ said Houston. ‘Nothing else is possible at this point. So martians it must be.’

        "content": "Last week, NASA announced that they had definitive proof of alien life on the far side of the moon. This morning, a press conference was held to retract the earlier statement. Apparently, the revolutionary telescope they recently finished building has a smudge on its ten billion dollar lens. 

        “We thought we had done a good job cleaning it, but it turns out we made the perfect man-shaped smudge,” said a representative from NASA. “We’re lucky that we needed the telescope for other planets. Otherwise we might never have known.”       
        
        Allegedly, the telescope spotted the same man on four different regions on the moon. The organization was very excited to have discovered a new intelligent species. That is, until another assignment made them point the telescope at a neighboring planet. When the exact same man was spotted in a mountain valley on Venus, Marvin Nikolaj realized that the shape must be on the telescope itself. He was the technician who alerted the NASA team of the problem. 
        
        Nikolaj was quoted as saying, “There is absolutely no way the same man could be in the frozen-over hell of the moon and also in the hellfires of Venus—unless he were dead. I mean, we tested the lenses a hundred times before installation. There was no way it was a manufacturing error. So I knew it had to be schmutz!”
        
        When asked how the problem can be fixed, the technician sighed, “It will be a space shuttle repair mission in about... seventeen months? Give or take? It’s top priority once the government shutdown is over and we get our funding.”
        
        A team of highly skilled astronauts will be required to apply space-grade windex to the telescope lens. A Chief Schmutz Inspector will be selected to wield the eleven-foot microfiber cloth that will be needed to shine the lens after the smudge is removed. Tests are currently being conducted to determine which member of the shuttle team is most qualified for the job. 
        
        “I have been doing wrist crunches for weeks,” said one of the astronauts. They wished to remain anonymous so that their teammates wouldn’t judge them for talking to the press prematurely. “It’s all about getting these forearms jacked,” the astronaut boasted, “this week, I’m up to four hours on the shake weight. Chief Schmutz Inspector is basically in the bag.” 
        
        Hopefully, the telescope will be available for full use in 2022. Until then, scientists have been alerted so that they can make calculations that work around the smudge. ",

A man got up from a bench, pulled out a harmonica and played along. Before you knew it, a circle had gathered around the pair. Someone started tapping on a glass bottle. Another person began to dance, while a couple joined in the singing. People were smiling and laughing, no longer strangers on the platform, we were united... the discomfort we thought we had to feel had morphed into a shared, human connection.

        An express train pulled into the station and drowned out the pair. The crowd dispersed and boarded the train, leaving the guitarist on the platform, playing the last few notes of his song.",
